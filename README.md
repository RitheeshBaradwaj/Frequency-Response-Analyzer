# Frequency-Response-Analyzer
The Low – Cost Frequency Response Analyzer Project was introduced with an idea to analyze the frequency domain characteristics of physical objects. The basic idea was that as we analyze the properties and characteristics of a physical object from it’s time domain characteristics, we can apply a similar approach to it’s frequency response. We can use the specific frequency domain characteristics of an object to identify any problems associated with it , determine it’s shelf life and much more.  The main task underlying was to find the Fourier transform of any set of information given in a fast and efficient way. Then this code developed for the calculation of Fourier transform had to be dumped into a microcontroller chip which would act as a block to calculate the frequency response of any real time signal. Under these considerations, our team of four students split into two teams, with two members each to focus separately on hardware and software aspects of the project.  Under the software team our main goal was to develop an efficient code for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) calculation of any real time data given. I and my team mate worked on the similar grounds to develop own code for FFT calculation. To account in brief, we first developed a MATLAB code for FFT calculation then later tried to convert it to C. This constitutes the part of work completed during the phase – 1 of the project.
